# Azure WAF Tuning - Postman collections & Deployment templates

This Postman collection demonstrates a high-level overview of understanding Azure WAF diagnostic logs to help identify how to create exclusions and custom rules for the Azure WAF on Azure Front Door. Using the collection, you'll be able to trigger different attacks that generate easy-to-follow logs to learn how to create Exclusions and Custom rules for false positives. For example, if you see in the log that there is a match for QueryParamValue, then you will create an exclusion using the Match variable of Query string args name.

| Log category | Match Variable |
|--------------|--------------------|
| HeaderValue | Request header name |
| CookieValue | Request cookie name |
| QueryParamValue | Query string args name |
| MultipartParamValue | Request body post args name |
| JsonValue | Request body JSON args name |
| URI | Custom Rule |


## How to import and use the Postman collection

### 1. Select Import on your workspace

![alt text](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Network-Security/blob/master/Azure%20WAF/Postman%20-%20Collections%20for%20Azure%20WAF/Images/Postman-Import.png?raw=true "Import")

You can either download the file locally and import from file selection, or you can use the raw url in GitHub and paste the url in the prompt.

### 2. Input Variables on the collection
Once the collection has been imported, select the collection called **Azure WAF Tuning â€“ Front Door** and select the **Variables** tab. Input the domain that is associated to your Front Door Profile.

### 3. Add a malicious cookie
Next, we'll create a malicious cookie to add to the request. This cookie will append itself to all requests for the domain until you remove it.

With the prompt open, input the domain from the previous step and select **Add domain**. You'll see the domain appear in the list but with no cookies. Select **Add Cookie** and replace *value* with **my!@#$%^&Cookie**. This value can be changed back and forth as the value of the cookie or the key of the cookie. In the example screenshot, **Cookie_1** is the key.

### 4. Send the request
Now our Postman collection is prepared, we can send a malicious request to our Azure WAF.
